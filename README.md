**2022-09-23: Mathematical Base Defenders is now open source\*!**

This is the source code for the non-`play` subdomain portion for Mathematical Base Defenders.

### Usage on Other Servers

Because this is open-source, you are free to use it on your own servers/domains. Feel free to modify the (horrible) source code, add your own modifications, and share!

Note: As of 2022-09-23, this source code has been exclusively made for Mathematical Base Defenders's official server. So if you are planning to use this in your own server (or domain), it might not work (You can still run it on localhost). This will be fixed sometime later.

Finally, please note that if the Game Master decides to do something stupid (e.g. host an 2x exp event), it will only be on the official server. Likewise, if you want to host your own event, it will only be on your server.

But this isn't the repository with the game content. Why would you want to host this on your own server?

### Contributing

If you instead want to contribute to the official server, feel free to open an issue/pull request!
